1. Download data from Google Drive - Sydney Dickner scans the participants and uploads the data. You should download all of the data at the path (Harddrive/fmri_processing\data). Ensure all of the correct data is there; it should match the formatting and files types of previous subjects. The Run#_Birds_0# folders may need adjusting of their names. If the images in a Run folder are in the format IM-0001-####, ensure the folder they are in is named Run1_Birds_01, or if the images are in the format IM-0002-####, ensure the folder containing them is named Run1_Birds_02 (as this is currently how the code finds them in its regex expressions). Important thing to also note is that there are 236 files in each of these Run folders, and 5 are discarded after the next step. Check the other folders to ensure they have the right amount of files too, can cross compare with prior subjects.

2. Run convert.py (Path – Harddrive/fmri_processing/scripts/convert.py) – This script was created by Richard Gerum, and if any problems arise with this he could likely help you with it. Potential for problems, as it was last set up particularly for my OS, and yours may differ. To double check that it worked correctly, ensure that 5 DCM’s were discarded into the discard folder in the data for each Run for the subject you ran it for, and that a folder was created at Harddrive\fmri_processing\results\TC2See named “sub-##”, with the subject number you chose. Should match the format of prior data.

3. Run the fmriPrep command line (in the text file at the root folder and change the number after “–participant-label” in the command line to the subject number you’re running it on). You will need Docker installed for this. It should say that fmriPrep has started successfully when it begins, and tell you if it finished successfully. This process in my experience takes around 10 hours on average, thus I usually run it overnight. Richard should also be able to help if there are any problems with this script or problems in running it. If it has run successfully, it should create a folder named “sub-##” for the subject you ran it for at Harddrive\fmri_processing\results\derivatives_TC2See_new. Ensure this folder follows the same formatting as prior ones, then copy it from the path it’s at, and paste it to this path E:\fmri_processing\results\derivatives_TC2See\fmriprep (this is where the Decoding code accesses it from).

4. The Decoding codes of importance are tc2see-noise-ceiling and tc2see-decoding (found at Harddrive\fmri-preprocessing\notebooks\tc2see). Ensure you pip install everything necessary to run them, the requirements.txt, and potentially a few more, and then all of the coding cells can be run. Should be fairly self-explanatory through the markdown cells, and further instructions are included at the bottom of the tc2see-decoding file.
